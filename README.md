## Project Description
Safe Escape - (Write Description)

## Project Requirements

### The minimum project requirements are as follows:
- Front End Framework (React/Angular)
- Back End Framework (Node + Express/ASP.NET Core/Java Spring)
- Database (SQL or NoSQL, API)
- Styled with CSS
- Responsive
### Stretch Goals
- These stretch goals are NOT required. They are only suggestions for what you might want to add to your project after you have completed the requirements.
- Deployed to a cloud server (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Integrate at least one API other than your own (Google Maps, Github, Dropbox, etc)
- Include a Many To Many relationship in your database
- Create a User Registration and Login
- Use JWT tokens to authenticate and authorize users
## Project Plan
six-week project plan for developing the requirements:

### Week 1: Development of Project Plan
- Gather requirements and clarify any ambiguities.
- Define project scope, objectives, and deliverables.
- Identify the key tasks and milestones.
- Create a project schedule and allocate resources.
- Develop a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed.

### Week 2: Front End Development
- Choose a front-end framework (React/Angular) based on project requirements.
- Set up the development environment and project structure.
- Create the basic layout and components for the user interface.
- Implement responsive design using CSS.
- Test and debug the front-end code.

### Week 3: Back End Development
- Choose a back-end framework (Node + Express/ASP.NET Core/Java Spring) based on project requirements.
- Set up the development environment and project structure.
- Create server-side routes and API endpoints to handle client requests.
- Implement the necessary business logic and data validation.
- Integrate the chosen database (SQL or NoSQL) and design the data schema.
- Test and debug the back-end code.

### Week 4: Integration and Database Development
- Implement the chosen database (SQL or NoSQL) and set up the required tables/collections.
- Create necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for database interactions.
- Integrate the front-end and back-end components.
- Test and debug the integration between front-end and back-end.
- Implement any additional features required for the minimum project requirements.

### Week 5: Stretch Goals Implementation
- If the minimum project requirements are completed, start working on the stretch goals.
- Deploy the application to a cloud server (AWS, Azure, GCP) and configure necessary infrastructure.
- Integrate at least one external API (Google Maps, Github, Dropbox, etc.) into the project.
- Implement a Many-to-Many relationship in the database, if applicable.
- Create user registration and login functionality.
- Use JWT tokens for authentication and authorization of users.

### Week 6: Testing, Refinement, Documentation and Demonstration
- Perform comprehensive testing of the entire application, including unit tests and integration tests.
- Fix any bugs or issues discovered during testing.
- Optimize the application for performance and responsiveness.
- Create user documentation or developer documentation, as required.
- Prepare the application for deployment, ensuring all dependencies and configurations are properly documented.

Note: The duration of each week may vary based on the complexity of the project and available resources. Adjustments can be made to the timeline based on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
